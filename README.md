# ðŸ§  SciCloud

**SciCloud** is a simple Python tool to tokenize text documents, clean and normalize the tokens, and generate high-resolution word clouds based on word frequencies. It's built with `NLTK`, `matplotlib`, and `wordcloud`, and features a GUI file dialog for loading text files and saving the output.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Word frequency analysis
- Customizable word clouds
- Interactive file selection for both input and output
- Tokenize text using NLTK, with special handling for common patterns like `al.`
- Custom and standard stopword removal

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Installation Guide
#### 1.1 Clone the repository

First, clone the repository locally.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/henrique-back/scicloud.git
```
#### 1.2 Create a virtual environment

Next, create a virtual environment. Open the terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- **Windows**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

- **Linux**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### 1.3 Install the SciCloud Package

```bash
pip install .
```

### 2. Create .txt file
SciCloud will read a .txt file containing the text to be processed. This is usually a compilation of abstracts from scientific publications, but could be any kind of text.
To do this, simply create a new .txt file in the docs folder. Then, copy and paste all the texts you wish to include.
SciCloud will treat everything as a single document, so don't worry about indicating where one abstract finishes and the other starts.

### 3. Run main.py
In the terminal, run python -m src.main

You'll be prompted to choose a .txt file. After processing, a word cloud will be displayed, and you'll be prompted to save it.

## Word Cloud Example

Here is an example of the word cloud generated from the input text:

This word cloud visualizes the most frequent terms from the abstracts of scientific publications in 2024 by the MERS (Marine and Environmental Biogeosciences) research group at the Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona.
